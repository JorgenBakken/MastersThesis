  abstract = {Automatic generation of metadata is an important component of multimedia search-by-content systems as it both avoids the need for manual annotation as well as minimising subjective descriptions and human errors. This paper explores the automatic attachment of basic descriptions (or dasiaTagspsila) to human motion held in a motion-capture database on the basis of a dynamic time warping (DTW) approach. The captured motion is held in the Acclaim ASF/AMC format commonly used in game and movie motion capture work and the approach allows for the comparison and classification of motion from different subjects. The work analyses the bone rotations important to a small set of movements and results indicate that only a small set of examples is required to perform reliable motion classification.},

  abstract = {Former er typisk beskrecet som det som er igjen av et objekt uten å ta hensyn til plassering, rotasjon og størrelse. En stor del av formanalyse består av å definere likheter og forskjeller mellom formene for å utføre ulike applikasjoner, som for eksempel interpolasjon. En avstandfunksjon er så definert, og i denne avhandlingen vil en elastisk måleenhet fra [37] bli brukt. Siden denne måleenheten endrer seg for kurver med ulik parametrisering, må vi minimere distansen over alle reparametriseringene når to kurver blir sammenlignet. Dette er et uendelig dimensjonalt optimeringsproblem og hovedfokuset i denne avhandlingen, hvor vi diskretiserer slik at i praksis så ender vi opp med å optimere bare over et endelig antall parametere. Flere iterative teknikker blir utprøvd for å løse optimeringsproblemet, som gradient descent og Adam. I tillegg blir et nevralt nettverk introdusert for å gjøre optimiseringen mer effektiv, hvor parametriseringsfunksjonen blir brukt som aktivasjonsfunksjonen i hvert lag som genererer den nye parametriseringen og dens deriverte. Implementasjonen algoritmene diskutert i avhandlingen har blitt utført ved bruk av Python og tensorbiblioteket for dyp læring, PyTorch.},

We study a family of metrics on the space of curves, that includes several recently proposed metrics, for which the metrics are characterised by mappings into vector spaces where geodesics can be easily computed. This family consists of Sobolev-type Riemannian metrics of order one on the space \$\textbackslash text\{Imm\}(S\textasciicircum 1,\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum 2)\$ of parametrized plane curves and the quotient space \$\textbackslash text\{Imm\}(S\textasciicircum 1,\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum 2)/\textbackslash text\{Diff\}(S\textasciicircum 1)\$ of unparametrized curves. For the space of open parametrized curves we find an explicit formula for the geodesic distance and show that the sectional curvatures vanish on the space of parametrized and are non-negative on the space of unparametrized open curves. For the metric, which is induced by the "R-transform", we provide a numerical algorithm that computes geodesics between unparameterised, closed curves, making use of a constrained formulation that is implemented numerically using the RATTLE algorithm. We illustrate the algorithm with some numerical tests that demonstrate it's efficiency and robustness.},

This technical report reviews, under a unifying viewpoint, three common alternatives to representing the rotation part: sets of three (yaw-pitch-roll) Euler angles, orthogonal rotation matrices from \$\textbackslash mathbf\{SO\}(3)\$ and quaternions. It will be described: (i) the equivalence between these representations and the formulas for transforming one to each other (in all cases considering the translational and rotational parts as a whole), (ii) how to compose poses with poses and poses with points in each representation and (iii) how the uncertainty of the poses (when modeled as Gaussian distributions) is affected by these transformations and compositions. Some brief notes are also given about the Jacobians required to implement least-squares optimization on manifolds, an very promising approach in recent engineering literature. The text reflects which MRPT C++ library functions implement each of the described algorithms. All formulas and their implementation have been thoroughly validated by means of unit testing and numerical estimation of the Jacobians},

  abstract = {Since they were introduced in the 1990s, Lie group integrators have become a method of choice in many application areas. These include multibody dynamics, shape analysis, data science, image registration and biophysical simulations. Two important classes of intrinsic Lie group integrators are the Runge–Kutta–Munthe–Kaas methods and the commutator free Lie group integrators. We give a short introduction to these classes of methods. The Hamiltonian framework is attractive for many mechanical problems, and in particular we shall consider Lie group integrators for problems on cotangent bundles of Lie groups where a number of different formulations are possible. There is a natural symplectic structure on such manifolds and through variational principles one may derive symplectic Lie group integrators. We also consider the practical aspects of the implementation of Lie group integrators, such as adaptive time stepping. The theory is illustrated by applying the methods to two nontrivial applications in mechanics. One is the N-fold spherical pendulum where we introduce the restriction of the adjoint action of the group SE(3) to TS2, the tangent bundle of the two-dimensional sphere. Finally, we show how Lie group integrators can be applied to model the controlled path of a payload being transported by two rotors. This problem is modelled on R6×SO(3)×so(3)2×(TS2)2 and put in a format where Lie group integrators can be applied.},

An important part of the Lie group methods involves the computation of a coordinate map and its derivative. Various options are available, and they vary in cost, accuracy and ability to approximately conserve invariants. We discuss how the computation of these maps can be optimized for the rigid body case, and we provide numerical experiments which give an idea of the performance of Lie group methods compared to other known integration schemes.},

For every connected \$C\textasciicircum\textbackslash infty\$ manifold \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$ with a base point \$p\$, we construct an algebra \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1 = \textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}, p)\$ consisting of iterated integrals, whose value along each loop at \$p\$ depends only on the homotopy class of the loop. Thus \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1\$ can be taken as a commutative algebra of functions on the fundamental group \$\textbackslash pi\_1(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\$, whose multiplication induces a comultiplication \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1 \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1 \textbackslash otimes \textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1\$, which makes \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1\$ a Hopf algebra. The algebra \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1\$ relates the fundamental group to analysis of the manifold, and we obtain some analytical conditions which are sufficient to make the fundamental group nonabelian or nonsolvable. We also show that \$\textbackslash pi\textasciicircum 1\$ depends essentially only on the differentiable homotopy type of the manifold. The second half of the paper is devoted to the study of structures of algebras of iterated path integrals. We prove that such algebras can be constructed algebraically from the following data: (a) the commutative algebra \$A\$ of \$C\textasciicircum\textbackslash infty\$ functions on \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$; (b) the \$A\$-module \$M\$ of \$C\textasciicircum\textbackslash infty\$ 1-forms on \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$; (c) the usual differentiation \$d: A \textbackslash rightarrow M\$; and (d) the evaluation map at the base point \$p, \textbackslash in: A \textbackslash rightarrow K, K\$ being the real (or complex) number field.},

The notes are split into two parts. The first part focuses on the definition and fundamental properties of the signature of a path, or the path signature. We have aimed for a minimalistic approach, assuming only familiarity with classical real analysis and integration theory, and supplementing theory with straightforward examples. We have chosen to focus in detail on the principle properties of the signature which we believe are fundamental to understanding its role in applications. We also present an informal discussion on some of its deeper properties and briefly mention the role of the signature in rough paths theory, which we hope could serve as a light introduction to rough paths for the interested reader. The second part of these notes discusses practical applications of the path signature to the area of machine learning. The signature approach represents a non-parametric way for extraction of characteristic features from data. The data are converted into a multi-dimensional path by means of various embedding algorithms and then processed for computation of individual terms of the signature which summarise certain information contained in the data. The signature thus transforms raw data into a set of features which are used in machine learning tasks. We will review current progress in applications of signatures to machine learning problems.},

Constructing geodesic paths between animations on those manifolds allows us to derive a distance function to measure similarities of different motions. This approach is derived from the field of geometric shape analysis, where such formalisms have been used to facilitate object recognition tasks. Analogously to the idea of shape spaces, we construct motion spaces consisting of equivalence classes of animations under reparametrizations. Especially cyclic motions can be represented elegantly in this framework. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach in multiple applications in the field of computer animation. First, we show how visual artefacts in cyclic animations can be removed by applying a computationally efficient manifold projection method. We next highlight how geodesic paths can be used to calculate interpolations between various animations in a computationally stable way. Finally, we show how the same mathematical framework can be used to perform cluster analysis on large motion capture databases, which can be used for or as part of motion retrieval problems.},

Curves are first represented as vector-valued measures, which incorporate both location and the first order geometric structure of the curves. Then, a Hilbert space structure is imposed on the measures to build the norm for quantifying the closeness between two curves. We describe a discretized version of this, in which discrete sequences of points along the curve are represented by vector-valued functionals. This gives a convenient and practical way to define a matching functional for curves. We derive and implement the curve matching in the large deformation framework and demonstrate mapping results of curves in ℝ2 and ℝ3. Behaviors of the curve mapping are discussed using 2D curves. The applications to shape classification is shown and experiments with 3D curves extracted from brain cortical surfaces are presented.},

We show that the equivalence classes form a group with some similarity to a free group, and that in each class there is a unique path that is tree reduced. The set of these paths is the Reduced Path Group. It is a continuous analogue of the group of reduced words. The signature of the path is a power series whose coefficients are certain tensor valued definite iterated integrals of the path. We identify the paths with trivial signature as the tree-like paths, and prove that two paths are in tree-like equivalence if and only if they have the same signature. In this way, we extend Chen's theorems on the uniqueness of the sequence of iterated integrals associated with a piecewise regular path to finite length paths and identify the appropriate extended meaning for parametrisation in the general setting. It is suggestive to think of this result as a noncommutative analogue of the result that integrable functions on the circle are determined, up to Lebesgue null sets, by their Fourier coefficients. As a second theme we give quantitative versions of Chen's theorem in the case of lattice paths and paths with continuous derivative, and as a corollary derive results on the triviality of exponential products in the tensor algebra.},

However, it is still a challenge to connect them by integrating the modeling and design process of both parts in a unified frame. As the properties associated with topology and performance, finite motion and instantaneous motion of the robot play key roles in the procedure. On the purpose of providing a fundamental preparation for integrated modeling and design, this paper carries out a review on the existing unified mathematic frameworks for motion description and computation, involving matrix Lie group and Lie algebra, dual quaternion and pure dual quaternion, finite screw and instantaneous screw. Besides the application in robotics, the review of the work from these mathematicians concentrates on the description, composition and intersection operations of the finite and instantaneous motions, especially on the exponential-differential maps which connect the two sides. Furthermore, an in-depth discussion is worked out by investigating the algebraical relationship among these methods and their further progress in integrated robotic development. The presented review offers insightful investigation to the motion description and computation, and therefore would help designers to choose appropriate mathematical tool in the integrated design and modeling and design of mechanisms and robots.},

This paper provides automated methods for identifying logically similar motions in a data set and using them to build a continuous and intuitively parameterized space of motions. To find logically similar motions that are numerically dissimilar, our search method employs a novel distance metric to find "close" motions and then uses them as intermediaries to find more distant motions. Search queries are answered at interactive speeds through a precomputation that compactly represents all possibly similar motion segments. Once a set of related motions has been extracted, we automatically register them and apply blending techniques to create a continuous space of motions. Given a function that defines relevant motion parameters, we present a method for extracting motions from this space that accurately possess new parameters requested by the user. Our algorithm extends previous work by explicitly constraining blend weights to reasonable values and having a run-time cost that is nearly independent of the number of example motions. We present experimental results on a test data set of 37,000 frames, or about ten minutes of motion sampled at 60 Hz.},

  abstract = {The shapes of plant leaves are important features to biologists, as they can help in distinguishing plant species, measuring their health, analyzing their growth patterns, and understanding relations between various species. Most of the methods that have been developed in the past focus on comparing the shape of individual leaves using either descriptors or finite sets of landmarks. However, descriptor-based representations are not invertible and thus it is often hard to map descriptor variability into shape variability. On the other hand, landmark-based techniques require automatic detection and registration of the landmarks, which is very challenging in the case of plant leaves that exhibit high variability within and across species. In this paper, we propose a statistical model based on the Squared Root Velocity Function (SRVF) representation and the Riemannian elastic metric of Srivastava et al. (2011) to model the observed continuous variability in the shape of plant leaves. We treat plant species as random variables on a non-linear shape manifold and thus statistical summaries, such as means and covariances, can be computed. One can then study the principal modes of variations and characterize the observed shapes using probability density models, such as Gaussians or Mixture of Gaussians. We demonstrate the usage of such statistical model for (1) efficient classification of individual leaves, (2) the exploration of the space of plant leaf shapes, which is important in the study of population-specific variations, and (3) comparing entire plant species, which is fundamental to the study of evolutionary relationships in plants. Our approach does not require descriptors or landmarks but automatically solves for the optimal registration that aligns a pair of shapes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on publicly available benchmarks such as the Flavia, the Swedish, and the ImageCLEF2011 plant leaf datasets.},

To demonstrate universality, we analyze the human action recognition problem in computer vision, using \$SO(3)\$ representations for the time series, providing comparable performance to other shallow learning approaches, while offering an easily interpretable feature set. We also provide a two-sample hypothesis test for Lie group-valued random walks to illustrate its characteristic property. Finally we provide algorithms and a Julia implementation of these methods.},

  abstract = {Comparison of protein structures is important for revealing the evolutionary relationship among proteins, predicting protein functions and predicting protein structures. Many methods have been developed in the past to align two or multiple protein structures. Despite the importance of this problem, rigorous mathematical or statistical frameworks have seldom been pursued for general protein structure comparison. One notable issue in this field is that with many different distances used to measure the similarity between protein structures, none of them are proper distances when protein structures of different sequences are compared. Statistical approaches based on those non-proper distances or similarity scores as random variables are thus not mathematically rigorous. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for protein structure comparison by treating protein structures as three-dimensional curves. Using an elastic Riemannian metric on spaces of curves, geodesic distance, a proper distance on spaces of curves, can be computed for any two protein structures. In this framework, protein structures can be treated as random variables on the shape manifold, and means and covariance can be computed for populations of protein structures. Furthermore, these moments can be used to build Gaussian-type probability distributions of protein structures for use in hypothesis testing. The covariance of a population of protein structures can reveal the population-specific variations and be helpful in improving structure classification. With curves representing protein structures, the matching is performed using elastic shape analysis of curves, which can effectively model conformational changes and insertions/deletions. We show that our method performs comparably with commonly used methods in protein structure classification on a large manually annotated data set.},

The signature takes its values in an algebra and always has a logarithm. In this paper we study the radius of convergence of the series corresponding to this logarithmic signature for the path. This convergence can be interpreted in control theory (in particular, the series can be used for effective computation of time invariant vector fields whose exponentiation yields the same diffeomorphism as a time inhomogeneous flow) and can provide efficient numerical approximations to solutions of SDEs. We give a simple lower bound for the radius of convergence of this series in terms of the length of the path. However, the main result of the paper is that the radius of convergence of the full log signature is finite for two wide classes of paths (and we conjecture that this holds for all paths different from straight lines).},

  abstract = {Rough path theory is focused on capturing and making precise the interactions between highly oscillatory and non-linear systems. It draws on the analysis of LC Young and the geometric algebra of KT Chen. The concepts and the uniform estimates, have widespread application and have simplified proofs of basic questions from the large deviation theory and extended Ito's theory of SDEs; the recent applications contribute to (Graham) automated recognition of Chinese handwriting and (Hairer) formulation of appropriate SPDEs to model randomly evolving interfaces. At the heart of the mathematics is the challenge of describing a smooth but potentially highly oscillatory and vector valued path \$x\_\{t\}\$ parsimoniously so as to effectively predict the response of a nonlinear system such as \$dy\_\{t\}=f(y\_\{t\})dx\_\{t\}\$, \$y\_\{0\}=a\$. The Signature is a homomorphism from the monoid of paths into the grouplike elements of a closed tensor algebra. It provides a graduated summary of the path \$x\$. Hambly and Lyons have shown that this non-commutative transform is faithful for paths of bounded variation up to appropriate null modifications. Among paths of bounded variation with given Signature there is always a unique shortest representative. These graduated summaries or features of a path are at the heart of the definition of a rough path; locally they remove the need to look at the fine structure of the path. Taylor's theorem explains how any smooth function can, locally, be expressed as a linear combination of certain special functions (monomials based at that point). Coordinate iterated integrals form a more subtle algebra of features that can describe a stream or path in an analogous way; they allow a definition of rough path and a natural linear "basis" for functions on streams that can be used for machine learning.},

Much effort has lately been put into research on geometric integration, i.e. the process of integrating a differential equation in suchaway that the configuration space is respected by the numerical solution. Some of these methods may be viewed as generalizations of classical methods, and we investigate the construction of intrinsic dense output devices as generalizations of the continuous Runge-Kutta methods.},

We investigate several Riemannian metrics on shape space: L2-metrics weighted by expressions in length and curvature. These include a scale invariant metric and a Wasserstein type metric which is sandwiched between two length-weighted metrics. Sobolev metrics of order n on curves are described. Here the horizontal projection of a tangent field is given by a pseudo-differential operator. Finally the metric induced from the Sobolev metric on the group of diffeomorphisms on R2 is treated. Although the quotient metrics are all given by pseudo-differential operators, their inverses are given by convolution with smooth kernels. We are able to prove local existence and uniqueness of solution to the geodesic equation for both kinds of Sobolev metrics. We are interested in all conserved quantities, so the paper starts with the Hamiltonian setting and computes conserved momenta and geodesics in general on the space of immersions. For each metric we compute the geodesic equation on shape space. In the end we sketch in some examples the differences between these metrics.},

  abstract = {Animated virtual human characters are a common feature in interactive graphical applications, such as computer and video games, online virtual worlds and simulations. Due to dynamic nature of such applications, character animation must be responsive and controllable in addition to looking as realistic and natural as possible. Though procedural and physics-based animation provide a great amount of control over motion, they still look too unnatural to be of use in all but a few specific scenarios, which is why interactive applications nowadays still rely mainly on recorded and hand-crafted motion clips. The challenge faced by animation system designers is to dynamically synthesize new, controllable motion by concatenating short motion segments into sequences of different actions or by parametrically blending clips that correspond to different variants of the same logical action. In this article, we provide an overview of research in the field of example-based motion synthesis for interactive applications. We present methods for automated creation of supporting data structures for motion synthesis and describe how they can be employed at run-time to generate motion that accurately accomplishes tasks specified by the AI or human user.},

This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.},

  abstract = {The present document is the draft of a book which presents an introduction to infinite-dimensional differential geometry beyond Banach manifolds. As is well known the usual calculus breaks down in this setting. Hence, we replace it by the more general Bastiani calculus which is built using directional derivatives. We then focus on two main areas of infinite-dimensional geometry: 1. infinite-dimensional Lie groups, and 2. weak Riemannian geometry. Both topics are developed and connected to manifolds of (smooth) mappings. These manifolds are studied in detail to construct important examples such as diffeomorphism groups, loop groups and Riemannian metrics for shape analysis. Manifolds of mappings are prime examples for surprising connections between finite and infinite-dimensional geometry. However, also pathologies occurring in infinite-dimensions will be highlighted in many examples. The geometric techniques developed will then be showcased in modern applications of geometry such as geometric hydrodynamics, higher geometry in the guise of Lie groupoids and rough path theory.},

  abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids clustering. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by eagerly performing additional swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster initialization strategies, because (i) the classic (“BUILD”) initialization now becomes the bottleneck, and (ii) our swap is fast enough to compensate for worse starting conditions. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications. While we do not study the parallelization of our approach in this work, it can easily be combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly important. In experiments on real data with k = 100, 200, we observed a 458× respectively 1191× speedup compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger data sets, and in particular to higher k.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many shape representations and geometric algorithms have been proposed for matching 3D shapes. Usually, each algorithm is tested on a different (small) database of 3D models, and thus no direct comparison is available for competing methods. We describe the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), a publicly available database of polygonal models collected from the World Wide Web and a suite of tools for comparing shape matching and classification algorithms. One feature of the benchmark is that it provides multiple semantic labels for each 3D model. For instance, it includes one classification of the 3D models based on function, another that considers function and form, and others based on how the object was constructed (e.g., man-made versus natural objects). We find that experiments with these classifications can expose different properties of shape-based retrieval algorithms. For example, out of 12 shape descriptors tested, extended Gaussian images by B. Horn (1984) performed best for distinguishing man-made from natural objects, while they performed among the worst for distinguishing specific object types. Based on experiments with several different shape descriptors, we conclude that no single descriptor is best for all classifications, and thus the main contribution of this paper is to provide a framework to determine the conditions under which each descriptor performs best.},

These representations include point sets, curves, surfaces, level sets, deformable templates, medial representations, and other feature-based methods. We discuss some common choices of Riemannian metrics and computational tools used for evaluating geodesic paths and geodesic distances for several of these shape representations. Then, we study the use of Riemannian frameworks in statistical modeling of variability within shape classes. Next, we turn to models and algorithms for activity analysis from various perspectives. We discuss how mathematical representations for human shape and its temporal evolutions in videos lead to analyses over certain special manifolds. We discuss the various choices of shape features, and parametric and non-parametric models for shape evolution, and how these choices lead to appropriate manifold-valued constraints. We discuss applications of these methods in gait-based biometrics, action recognition, and video summarization and indexing. For reader convenience, we also provide a short overview of the relevant tools from geometry and statistics on manifolds in the Appendix.},

In this SRV representation, the elastic metric simplifies to the IL2 metric, the reparameterization group acts by isometries, and the space of unit length curves becomes the unit sphere. The shape space of closed curves is the quotient space of (a submanifold of) the unit sphere, modulo rotation, and reparameterization groups, and we find geodesics in that space using a path straightening approach. These geodesics and geodesic distances provide a framework for optimally matching, deforming, and comparing shapes. These ideas are demonstrated using: 1) shape analysis of cylindrical helices for studying protein structure, 2) shape analysis of facial curves for recognizing faces, 3) a wrapped probability distribution for capturing shapes of planar closed curves, and 4) parallel transport of deformations for predicting shapes from novel poses.},

  abstract = {We define a novel metric on the space of closed planar curves. According to this metric centroid translations, scale changes and deformations are orthogonal, and the metric is also invariant with respect to reparameterizations of the curve. The Riemannian structure that is induced on the space of curves is a smooth Riemannian manifold, which is isometric to a classical well-known manifold. As a consequence, geodesics and gradients of energies defined on the space can be computed using fast closed-form formulas, and this has obvious benefits in numerical applications. The obtained Riemannian manifold of curves is apt to address complex problems in computer vision; one such example is the tracking of highly deforming objects. Previous works have assumed that the object deformation is smooth, which is realistic for the tracking problem, but most have restricted the deformation to belong to a finite-dimensional group - such as ane motions - or to finitely-parameterized models. This is too restrictive for highly deforming objects such as the contour of a beating heart. We adopt the smoothness assumption implicit in previous work, but we lift the restriction to finite-dimensional motions/deformations. We define a dynamical model in this Riemannian manifold of curves, and use it to perform filtering and prediction to infer and extrapolate not just the pose (a finitely parameterized quantity) of an object, but its deformation (an infinite-dimensional quantity) as well. We illustrate these ideas using a simple first-order dynamical model, and show that it can be eective even on data sets where existing methods fail.},

Our algorithm takes advantage of multiresolution analysis (MRA) for surfaces and constructs cortical surfaces at multiresolution. This family of multiresolution surfaces are used as natural sparse priors of the cortical anatomy and provide the anchor points where the parametrization of deformation vector fields is supported. This naturally constructs tangent bundles of diffeomorphisms at different resolution levels and hence generates multiresolution diffeomorphic transformation. We show that our construction of multiresolution LDDMM surface mapping can potentially reduce computational cost and improves the mapping accuracy of cortical surfaces.},

  abstract = {Temporal alignment is an inherent task in most applications dealing with videos: action recognition, motion transfer, virtual trainers, rehabilitation, etc. In this paper we dive into the understanding of this task from a geometric point of view: in particular, we show that the basic properties that are expected from a temporal alignment procedure imply that the set of aligned motions to a template form a slice to a principal fiber bundle for the group of temporal reparameterizations. A temporal alignment procedure provides a reparameterization invariant projection onto this particular slice. This geometric presentation allows to elaborate a consistency check for testing the accuracy of any temporal alignment procedure. We give examples of alignment procedures from the literature applied to motions of tennis players. Most of them use dynamic programming to compute the best correspondence between two motions relative to a given cost function. This step is computationally expensive (of complexity \$O(NM)\$ where \$N\$ and \$M\$ are the numbers of frames). Moreover most methods use features that are invariant by translations and rotations in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textasciicircum 3\$, whereas most actions are only invariant by translation along and rotation around the vertical axis, where the vertical axis is aligned with the gravitational field. The discarded information contained in the vertical direction is crucial for accurate synchronization of motions. We propose to incorporate keyframe correspondences into the dynamic programming algorithm based on coarse information extracted from the vertical variations, in our case from the elevation of the arm holding the racket. The temporal alignment procedures produced are not only more accurate, but also computationally more efficient.},

  abstract = {Classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) is a technique that displays the structure of distance-like data as a geometrical picture. It is a member of the family of MDS methods. The input for an MDS algorithm usually is not an object data set, but the similarities of a set of objects that may not be digitalized. The input distance matrix of CMDS is of Euclidean-type. There exists an r-dimensional vector set H such that the Euclidean distance matrix of H is equal to the input one. The set H is called a configuration of the input matrix. In the case that the dimension of the set H is too high to be visualized, we then need to reduce the dimension of the configuration to 2 or 3 for visualization. Sometimes, a little higher dimension is acceptable. CMDS is equivalent to PCA when the input of CMDS is a data set. The data model in CMDS is linked to a complete weighed graph, in which the nodes are objects and the weights are the similarities between the objects. This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 6.1, we introduce multidimensional scaling. In Section 6.2, we discuss the relation between Euclidean distance matrices and Gram matrices. The description of CMDS is in Section 6.3. The algorithm of CMDS is presented in Section 6.4.},

We address error propagation in rigid-body poses in a coordinate-free way. In this paper we show how errors propagated by convolution on the Euclidean motion group, SE(3), can be approximated to second order using the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups. We then show how errors that are small (but not so small that linearization is valid) can be propagated by a recursive formula derived here. This formula takes into account errors to second-order, whereas prior efforts only considered the first-order case. Our formulation is nonparametric in the sense that it will work for probability density functions of any form (not only Gaussians). Numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy of this second-order theory in the context of a manipulator arm and a flexible needle with bevel tip.},

  abstract = {D'Arcy Thompson (1960–1948) was one of the most celebrated biologists of his day, best known for his On Growth and Form (1917) which was the first successful biophysical explanation of the size and shape of organisms. In particular, his concept of allometric growth and theory of transformations have informed cutting edge research in biometrics and practice in the fields of fine art, urban design and civil engineering. He was a seminal figure in the development of the spatial analysis tradition within geography in the 1960s and 1970s underpinning major contributions by Haggett and Bunge and inspiring Tobler to develop cartograms which liberated map projections from sole reliance on Euclidean geometry. Re-assessing his contribution to geography fifty years later, it is still to be found in Batty's work on the size, shape and scale of cities and in Dorling's World Mapper project. This re-discovery of the importance of geometry within the geographic tradition over the last half century owes much to Thompson who spent the whole of his academic life in the University of St Andrews and (what was later to become) the University of Dundee.},

  abstract = {I denne oppgaven utvikler vi en ny metode for optimal omparametrisering av kurver ved bruk av rothastighetstransformasjonen (the square root velocity transform). Metoden bruker dynamisk programmering, men med en bedre håndtering av grunntilfellene enn tidligere metoder. Mens tidligere metoder er fullstendig diskretisert, er den nye metoden kun delvis diskretisert. Dette utnyttes til å oppnå både en bedre konvergensrate og lavere asymptotisk kjøretid sammenlignet med tilsvarende metoder. Under utviklingen av metoden introduser vi nye hjelpevariabler og nye differensialligninger som karakteriserer optimale løsninger. Metoden er lineær i omparametriseringsfunksjonene, og kvadratisk i avstandsestimatet. I enkelte tilfeller kan henholdsvis kvadratisk og super-kvadratisk konvergens oppnås ved hjelp av ekstrapolasjon. Dette underbygges av numeriske eksperimenter.},

  abstract = {We define distances between geometric curves by the square root of the minimal energy required to transform one curve into the other. The energy is formally defined from a left invariant Riemannian distance on an infinite dimensional group acting on the curves, which can be explicitly computed. The obtained distance boils down to a variational problem for which an optimal matching between the curves has to be computed. An analysis of the distance when the curves are polygonal leads to a numerical procedure for the solution of the variational problem, which can efficiently be implemented, as illustrated by experiments.},

  abstract = {More and more images have been generated in digital form around the world. There is a growing interest in finding images in large collections or from remote databases. In order to find an image, the image has to be described or represented by certain features. Shape is an important visual feature of an image. Searching for images using shape features has attracted much attention. There are many shape representation and description techniques in the literature. In this paper, we classify and review these important techniques. We examine implementation procedures for each technique and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Some recent research results are also included and discussed in this paper. Finally, we identify some promising techniques for image retrieval according to standard principles.},
