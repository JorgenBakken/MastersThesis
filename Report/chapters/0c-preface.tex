\chapter*{Preface}

This master's thesis marks the end of my five-year journey towards a Master of Science in Applied Physics and Mathematics, with a specialization in industrial mathematics, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

I am grateful for the guidance and inspiration provided by my supervisor, Professor Elena Celledoni. Her mentorship and dedication have been invaluable.

In addition, I would like to thank Carnegie Mellon University. The data used in this project was obtained from mocap.cs.cmu.edu, a database created with funding from NSF EIA-0196217.
