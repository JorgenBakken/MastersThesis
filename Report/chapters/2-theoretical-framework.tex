\chapter{Theoretical Framework}
\label{ch:theoretical-framework}

In this chapter, we lay the theoretical groundwork for the methodologies explored later in this thesis. We introduce fundamental concepts for Lie Groups, shape space, and tools for analyzing curves in \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) and \(\mathrm{SE}(3)\). Additionally, we consider the direct products \(\mathrm{SO}(3)^n\) and \(\mathrm{SE}(3)^n\), which facilitate the analysis of multiple rotations or rigid body motions, aiding in the study of complex shape dynamics in higher dimensions.
