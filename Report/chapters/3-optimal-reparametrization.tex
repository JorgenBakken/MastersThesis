\chapter{Optimal Reparameterization of Parametric Curves}
\label{ch:optimal-reparameterization}

Reparameterization lets us rewrite curves, capturing their inherent shape independent of how they're traced. This chapter explores methods for finding optimal reparameterizations to calculate the distance between shapes. We'll delve into these techniques, how they distinguish shapes, and analyze their properties.
