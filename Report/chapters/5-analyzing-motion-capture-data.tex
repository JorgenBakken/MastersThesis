\chapter{Analyzing Motion Capture Data}
\label{ch:analyzing-motion-capture-data}

In this chapter, we evaluate our shape analysis frameworks using real motion capture data from the CMU Motion Capture Library. This real-world test aims to validate the robustness and accuracy of our methods and explore the potential for combining them with post-processing techniques.
