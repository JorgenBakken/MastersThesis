\section[Dynamic Programming Using a Fully Discretized Method]{Dynamic Programming Using a Fully \\ Discretized Method}
\label{sec:dynamic-programming}

In this section, we present a fully discretized method for solving the optimal reparameterization problem using dynamic programming. We apply the Square Root Velocity Transform (SRVT) to a discretized curve and then use dynamic programming techniques to find the optimal solution. We will detail the implementation process, discuss the search depth, and provide numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
