\section{Post-Processing Techniques}
\label{sec:post-processing}

To enhance our analysis results and quantify the performance of our methods, we will explore various post-processing techniques. These techniques aim to improve the results and provide a deeper understanding of the data. We will employ methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), classical Multidimensional Scaling (cMDS), and the k-medoids clustering algorithm. Additionally, we will utilize the silhouette score as an evaluation metric to assess the quality of the clustering.
